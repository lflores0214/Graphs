UNDERSTAND
Inputs: Dataset(ancestors), ID(starting_node)
given the inputs find the earliest known ancestor
The one at the farthest distance from starting_node
If there are two nodes tied for earliest ancestor, return the smaller one
If the starting node has no parents, return -1

Clarifications:
    - The input will not be empty.

    - There are no cycles in the input.

    - There are no "repeated" ancestors – if two individuals are connected, it is by exactly one path.

    - IDs will always be positive integers.

    - A parent may have any number of children.


After looking at the README it seems like a Depth first search would be the best way to go about this
inputs are pairs (creating an edge) so for (1,3) 1 would be the parent and 3 would be the child

PLAN 
initialize a graph
initialize a stack
create a path variable

build edges in reverse so we can go from child to parent instead of parent to child

keep track of longest path
